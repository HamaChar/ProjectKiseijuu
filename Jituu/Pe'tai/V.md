# V████
**ᴀ ʀᴇᴍɴᴀɴᴛ ᴏꜰ "ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜɴɢʀʏ ᴏɴᴇ"**

After The Reconciliation, the growth of **ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜɴɢʀʏ ᴏɴᴇ** gradually slowed down, but did not become stagnant. Mercy of Eaclestrom sees **ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜɴɢʀʏ ᴏɴᴇ** as one of its own children, and has never given thought to even harming it.

The V████ is a mere species of many of **ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜɴɢʀʏ ᴏɴᴇ**'s many other evolutions, but this one was different. The V████ has evolved from its harsh conditions after Pe'tai's long journey through space. From scarce resources, to the opposite extremes in temperature, the V████ has achieved resilience to intense natural circumstances.

The V████ attains a parasitic genome from its ancestors, and feeds upon its host bacteria living on Pe'tai. As Pe'tai's journey rests in Jituu's orbit, the V████ has only gotten opportunity to reach another host: Se'yai.
